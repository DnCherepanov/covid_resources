## Getting Started

For the lazy:

- `npm i` to build that big ol' `node_modules` folder
- `npm run dev` to boot up that dev server and start building
- `npm run build` when you're ready to build a production bundle

**Bonus**
`npm run build && npx serve dist` will boot up a local server of your production site!
